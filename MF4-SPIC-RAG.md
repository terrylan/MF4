description: "A standard process for idea creation leveraging AI and structured frameworks."

## 2. Principles
principles:
  - name: "Clarity"
    description: "Use structured documents (e.g., headings, bullets) for AI/human interpretation."
    example: "Recipe with clear steps: 1. Mix flour and water, 2. Knead dough, 3. Bake at 350°F."
  - name: "Recursion"
    description: "Build frameworks within frameworks for complex tasks."
    example: "A project management framework with sub-frameworks for planning, execution, and review."
  - name: "AI-Driven"
    description: "Leverage AI to draft outputs (e.g., text, plans)."
    example: "AI generates a 500-word business proposal based on a prompt: 'Draft a plan for a tech startup.'"
  - name: "Iteration"
    description: "Refine until Success Metrics are met."
    example: "Version 1 of a logo design revised to Version 2 after feedback to achieve 90% client approval."
  - name: "Universality"
    description: "Applies to any task (Creative, Analytical, etc.)."
    example: "Used to design a painting (creative) and analyze sales data (analytical) with the same process."
  - name: "Flexibility"
    description: "Adaptable to any domain, from software to policies."
    example: "Adjusted to create a software testing plan and a school attendance policy."
  - name: "Collaboration"
    description: "Combines human insight with AI generation."
    example: "Human defines a story outline, AI writes the first draft, human edits for tone."
  - name: "Efficiency"
    description: "Accelerates creation by leveraging AI’s speed."
    example: "AI completes a 10-page report draft in 5 minutes, human refines it in 1 hour."

## 3. Process Structure
process:
  - step: "Define"
    substeps:
      - name: "Principles"
        description: "Guiding rules (e.g., 'Simple, affordable design')."
      - name: "Instructions"
        description: "How to execute (e.g., 'AI: Draft a 500-word plan')."
      - name: "Parameters"
        description: "Scope/goals (e.g., 'Budget: $100, Time: 1 week')."
  - step: "AI Generate"
    description: "AI produces a draft based on inputs."
    example_prompt: "Generate X using Y."
  - step: "Iterate"
    description: "Refine output (e.g., 'v1: Draft; v2: Adjusted after feedback') until metrics achieved."

## 4. Recommendations
recommendations:
  - name: "Document Design"
    description: "Use headings, bullets for clarity."
  - name: "Recursion"
    description: "If task complexity >5 steps, define sub-frameworks (Principles, Instructions, Parameters)."
  - name: "Success Metrics"
    description: "Define per task (e.g., 'Creative: 80% approval; Technical: Error-free')."
  - name: "Exit"
    description: "Stop when metrics met and no new feedback after 2 iterations."
  - name: "AI Tools"
    description: "Use web search, content analysis for richer outputs."
