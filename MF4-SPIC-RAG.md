  - step: "AI Generate"
    description: "AI produces a draft based on inputs."
    example_prompt: "Generate X using Y."
  - step: "Iterate"
    description: "Refine output (e.g., 'v1: Draft; v2: Adjusted after feedback') until metrics achieved."

recommendations:
  - name: "Document Design"
    description: "Use headings, bullets for clarity."
  - name: "Recursion"
    description: "If task complexity >5 steps, define sub-frameworks (Principles, Instructions, Parameters)."
  - name: "Success Metrics"
    description: "Define per task (e.g., 'Creative: 80% approval; Technical: Error-free')."
  - name: "Exit"
    description: "Stop when metrics met and no new feedback after 2 iterations."
  - name: "AI Tools"
    description: "Use web search, content analysis for richer outputs."
