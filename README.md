# MF4:SPIC - Meta Framework For Framework: a Standard Process for Idea Creation

**Tagline**: "Define. Generate. Iterate. Validate. Create Anything with AI."

Welcome to **MF4:SPIC**—a meta-framework that transforms how you create. No rigid codebases here—just a vision, an AI, and a process that scales from a quick draft to enterprise solutions. Version 2.0 supercharges this with advanced AI, collaboration, and consolidation, all driven by human-AI synergy.

## What is MF4:SPIC?
MF4:SPIC (Meta Framework For Framework: a Standard Process for Idea Creation) is a four-step cycle:
1. **Define**: Craft a RAG file with principles, instructions, parameters, and scalability rules.
2. **AI Generate**: Tools like Grok 3 (xAI) turn your RAG into drafts—code, plans, anything—fast and in parallel.
3. **Iterate**: Refine with feedback, collaboration tools, and YAML outputs per cycle.
4. **Validate**: AI ensures your output nails the specs before finalizing.

Your RAG is the core—regenerate outputs anytime. Version 2.0 adds versioning, metric templates, real-time collaboration, and more.

## Why MF4?
- **Unbound Creativity**: Build *your* idea, not a preset mold.
- **Universal Scale**: From SPMP to policies, it adapts to any domain with mapping.
- **AI-Powered**: Parallel generation, validation, and consolidation accelerate everything.

## Example: SPMP
We used MF4 to create **SPMP** (Standard PHP-MVC-Principles). [`SPMP-RAG.md`](./examples/spmp/SPMP-RAG.md) defined it, Grok 3 generated scripts and schemas in [`output/`](./examples/spmp/output/), and v2.0’s YAML consolidation tracked every step. Lost files? RAG rebuilds them.

## Get Started
1. **Clone**: `git clone https://github.com/terrylan/MF4.git`
2. **Explore**: Check [`MF4-SPIC-RAG.v2.0.yml`](./MF4-SPIC-RAG.v2.0.yml) for the enhanced process.
3. **Prompt**: Feed an AI (e.g., Grok 3) your RAG: "Generate from this with Grok and web search."
4. **Iterate**: Tweak, validate, and watch your idea evolve.
