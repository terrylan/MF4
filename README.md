# MF4:SPIC - Meta Framework For Framework: a Standard Process for Idea Creation

Welcome to **MF4:SPIC**—a groundbreaking meta-framework that redefines creation. Forget downloading rigid codebases. With MF4, you craft a vision, hand it to an AI, and watch a custom system emerge—then refine it to perfection. It’s not just a tool; it’s a revolution in how we build, powered by human-AI synergy.

## What is MF4:SPIC?
MF4:SPIC stands for **Meta Framework For Framework: a Standard Process for Idea Creation**. It’s a three-step cycle:
1. **Define**: Write a document—your RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)—with principles, instructions, and parameters.
2. **AI Generate**: An AI (like Grok 3 by xAI) turns your RAG into a draft—code, text, or any system you envision.
3. **Iterate**: Refine the RAG or output until it’s exactly what you need.

The magic lies in the RAG file. It’s your asset—the soul of your idea. The files it generates? Mere shadows, endlessly regenerable by AI.

## Why MF4?
- **Unbound Creativity**: Build what *you* imagine, not what a framework dictates.
- **Universal Power**: From software (like SPMP) to policies, MF4 scales to any definable task.
- **AI-Driven**: Leverage AI to accelerate and innovate, guided by your vision.

## Example: SPMP
We used MF4 to create **SPMP** (Standard PHP-MVC-Principles), a lightweight PHP framework. The [`SPMP-RAG.md`](./examples/spmp/SPMP-RAG.md) defined it, and Grok 3 generated a shell script and schema in [`output/`](./examples/spmp/output/). Lost the files? The RAG rebuilds them. That’s MF4’s strength.

## Get Started
1. **Clone**: `git clone https://github.com/terrylan/MF4.git`
2. **Explore**: Open [`MF4-SPIC-RAG.md`](./MF4-SPIC-RAG.md) to see the process.
3. **Prompt**: Use an AI (e.g., Grok 3 by xAI) with a RAG: "Generate from this."
