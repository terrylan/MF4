# MF4-Modules

## Overview

The `MF4-Modules` folder is a collection of individual modules designed to enhance the **MF4:SPIC-RAG** framework (Meta Framework For Framework: a Standard Process for Idea Creation). Each module is a standalone component that extends cognitive and problem-solving capabilities, supporting the "separate but integrable" philosophy. These modules can be uploaded alongside MF4 to an AI (like Grok 3 by xAI) to dynamically enhance its reasoning for specific tasks.

This ecosystem currently includes the **Mathematical Problem-Solving Module (MPSM)** and 20 additional modules focused on cognitive expansion, all versioned at 1.0. The goal is to provide flexible, plug-and-play tools that users can combine with MF4 as needed.

## List of Modules

Below is the complete list of modules housed in this folder, each stored in its own subdirectory with a corresponding YAML file (e.g., `MPSM/MPSM.v1.0.yml`).

1. **MPSM** - Mathematical Problem-Solving Module  
2. **MAM** - Memory Augmentation Module  
3. **IRM** - Intuitive Reasoning Module  
4. **LCM** - Linguistic Creativity Module  
5. **ERM** - Emotional Resilience Module  
6. **SCM** - Spatial Cognition Module  
7. **TRM** - Temporal Reasoning Module  
8. **ETM** - Ethical Reasoning Module  
9. **ISM** - Imaginative Simulation Module  
10. **CSN** - Cognitive Synchronization Module  
11. **ARM** - Abstract Reasoning Module  
12. **SIM** - Sensory Integration Module  
13. **CTM** - Critical Thinking Module  
14. **NEM** - Neuroplasticity Enhancement Module  
15. **CCM** - Cultural Cognition Module  
16. **DLM** - Dream Logic Module  
17. **RAM** - Risk Assessment Module  
18. **IDS** - Interdisciplinary Synthesis Module  
19. **CEM** - Cognitive Energy Module  
20. **PRM** - Pattern Recognition Module  
21. **TCM** - Transpersonal Cognition Module  

## Description

Each module is a self-contained unit with a specific purpose:
- **MPSM** provides advanced mathematical problem-solving capabilities, originally envisioned as an omnibus ecosystem but now focused on math-specific enhancements.
- The **20 cognitive expansion modules** target distinct aspects of human and AI cognition, from memory and intuition to ethics and cosmic perspectives. These modules are designed to be lightweight, modular, and compatible with MF4, allowing users to tailor the framework to their needs.

The YAML files (e.g., `MPSM.v1.0.yml`) contain metadata and placeholders for module-specific content, ready for further development or immediate use.

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download**:
   - Clone this repository or download the `MF4-Modules` folder:
     ```bash
     git clone <repo-url>
     cd MF4-Modules
     ```

2. **Integrate with MF4**:
   - Upload the desired module YAML files (e.g., `MPSM/MPSM.v1.0.yml`, `MAM/MAM.v1.0.yml`) alongside your `MF4:SPIC-RAG` file to an AI platform (like Grok 3).
   - Example: Start a chat session and provide both MF4 and the module files to the AI.

3. **Invoke Modules**:
   - In your query, specify which modules to use, or let the AI select based on context. For example:
     - "Use MPSM to explain eigenvalues."
     - "Combine MAM and SCM to help me visualize and remember a 4D hypercube."

4. **Customize**:
   - Edit the YAML files to add detailed components, instructions, or parameters specific to your use case.

5. **Contribute**:
   - Fork this repo, enhance module files, and submit PRs to expand the ecosystem.
