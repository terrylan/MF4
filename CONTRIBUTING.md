# Contributing to MF4:SPIC

MF4:SPIC—Meta Framework For Framework: a Standard Process for Idea Creation—is a community-driven revolution. Your creativity can make it soar—whether it’s a new RAG file, a generated example, or a wild idea. Join us in shaping the future of AI-assisted creation!

## Why Contribute?
MF4:SPIC grows with every contribution. It’s a recursive process—your input doesn’t just add to it; it multiplies its potential. Help us build a meta-framework that inspires the world.

## How to Contribute
- **RAG Files**: Craft new RAGs to define systems (e.g., software, policies) with MF4.
- **Examples**: Share RAG-generated outputs (e.g., scripts, schemas) in `examples/`.
- **Feedback**: Open issues to brainstorm features or refinements.
- **Docs**: Enhance the core RAG (`MF4-SPIC-RAG.md`) or supporting files.

## Contribution Process
1. **Fork**: Grab the repo: `https://github.com/terrylan/MF4`.
2. **Create**: Follow MF4—define a RAG, generate with an AI (like Grok 3 by xAI), and iterate. Credit your AI in the output (e.g., “Generated by Grok 3 (xAI)”).
3. **Submit**: 
   - Branch it: Use `rag/[name]` for RAGs (e.g., `rag/policy-system`) or `example/[name]` for outputs.
   - Push and open a Pull Request (PR) with a clear title and description.
   - For ideas, file an issue instead.
4. **Collaborate**: We’ll review, iterate, and merge together.

## Example
Want to add a policy system?
- Define a RAG in `examples/policy/Policy-RAG.md`.
- Generate a draft with Grok 3, saving it to `examples/policy/output/`.
- Branch: `rag/policy-system`.
- PR: “Add Policy System RAG and Output.”

## Guidelines
- Structure RAGs with Principles, Instructions, Parameters.
- Test outputs with an AI to ensure they work.
- Embrace recursion—think big, refine often, and credit your AI partner.
